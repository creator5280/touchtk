### Software Goals ###
The current goals of this library and its usage

1. Library should be easily accessable and self contained --> easy integration into projects and programs
2. Library should be intuitive to program in without much need for guidance
    - Provide intuitive handles and a straightforward object structure
    - Use as few types of seperate widgets as possible (widget should contextually construct tkinter objects according to usage)
3. Library should be stable and platform independant, able to be used on any system supporting tkinter
    - Library should fully support python 2.x and 3.x with the same opperation on each
    - Dependancies should be few and common
4. Library should provide helpful and explanatory help messages upon exceptions and unexpected conditions
5. Library should be optimized to require as little processor time for a GUI as possible
    - Perform early computations in favor of live computations for animations and appearances
    - Use fast access data types to store data
    - Avoid superfluous features
